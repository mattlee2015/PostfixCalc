 The point of this project was to have us create a typed version of a calculator using the shunting yard algorithm. In other words, we used the stacks and queues methods and implemented them into having a typical math equation turn into a postfix form. With this, we then used the stack again to compute/evauluate the expression. In terms of the files that are within the folder, they are basically from the previous hw labs (stacks and queues) and I used their methods to do the infix to postfix conversion and postfix evaluation method. As for struggles I thought that the most challenging part was the infix to postfix method because not only did I have to keep track of what should go into the queue and stack but also had to be aware of the order of precedence for the order of operation.
